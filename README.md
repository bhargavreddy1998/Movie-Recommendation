# Movie-Recommendation
Implemented a Film and TV Series application using JDBC for the Oracle database connection and JAVA for the UI design.

The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Film and TV series data, helping viewers obtain various commercial and critical aspects of productions. The application also facilitates querying films/shows based on attributes like genre, director, writer, or lead actor. It provides insights into a filmâ€™s commercial success (box office revenue) and critical reception (IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, and awards won) to assist users in content selection.
